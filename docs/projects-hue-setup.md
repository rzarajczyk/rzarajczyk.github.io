# Hue Setup

This is an app for automating the setup of a [Philips Hue](https://www.philips-hue.com/) bridge.
It keeps the setup of the whole bridge (lights, automations, etc.) in a YAML file, so it can be easily restored.

## WARNING: this app is destructive!

This app is destructive - it will destroy your current configuration. Don't use it "just to check" - you will regret it!

**Not recommended for the general usage**. It's a tool for me, I share the source code with you for your curiosity,
but it's not a commercial product.

I do not provide any further documentation or support for this app. If you want to use it, you need to read the source
code.
