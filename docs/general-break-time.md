# Break time!

## Brief description
A little GUI software that enforeces short micro-breaks every configurable period of time.
It's designed as an eye protection - in accordance with ophthalmological guidelines if you
work on a computer a lot, you should look at some distant spot from time to time to make sure
your eyes have some training in changing focus.

## History
This is a project written 10 years ago (or more... I don't even know) in some old
Java by unexperienced version of me :-)

In 2024 it was brought back to life by upgrading to Java 21, updating dependencies 
and fixing compatibility issues.
No source code was modified except of compatibility issues - so if you take a look inside,
you may feel like in a time traveler :-)
