# Hue Setup

This is an app for automating the setup of a Philips Hue bridge.
It keeps the setup of the whole bridge (lights, automations, etc.) in a YAML file, so it can be easily restored.


## WARNING: this app is destructive!

This app is destructive - it will destroy your current configuration. Don't use it "just to check" - you will regret it!

**Not recommended for the general usage**. It's a tool for me, and I share it with you, but it's not a commercial product.
