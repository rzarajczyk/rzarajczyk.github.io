# No warranties given

I made a significant effort to create this page. I did my best to make sure, that
everything I write here is true (at the moment of writing) and I saw all the code
working before putting it here. 

You can use knowledge and resources from this website free of charge.
I will be grateful for sharing this website if you find it helpful,
but it's not a hard requirement.

I might have, however, made some mistake or gather too shallow or even incorrect
knowledge by myself before writing.

**I do not give any warranties nor take any responsibility for information and resources
on this website**. 

In case of scripts, you take it as is, you can read the code, and you
decide whether to run in on your own risk or not.

In case of knowledge, you are encouraged to reconfirm the information in the other sources
(in fact this advice should apply to all the internet knowledge :-)), taking into
account variety of computer system, possible changes in time and my potential mistakes.
