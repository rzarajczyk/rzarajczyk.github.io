Voice of [Józef Piłsudzki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J%C3%B3zef_Pi%C5%82sudski), recorded on Sep 5th, **1924** (that's
almost 100 years ago!)

## [Around The Corner - How Differential Steering Works](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYAw79386WI)

The documentary recorded in **1937** (yeap, it's before WW2). This is the best
video about differential I have ever seen, and the first one which allowed
me to really understand how does it work. 

Note to Polish readers: `differential` in Polish is `mechanizm różnicowy`
